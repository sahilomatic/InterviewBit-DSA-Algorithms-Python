"""
Problem Description

Given a linked list which contains some loop.

You need to find the node, which creates a loop, and break it by making the node point to NULL.



Problem Constraints

1 <= number of nodes <= 1000



Input Format

Only argument is the head of the linked list.



Output Format

return the head of the updated linked list.



Example Input

Input 1:

 
1 -> 2
^    |
| - - 
Input 2:

3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
          ^         |
          |         |    
          - - - - - -


Example Output

Output 1:

 1 -> 2 -> NULL
Output 2:

 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Chain of 1->2 is broken.
Explanation 2:

 Chain of 4->6 is broken.
