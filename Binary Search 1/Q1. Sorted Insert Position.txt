"""
Problem Description

Given a sorted array A of size N and a target value B, return the index (0-based indexing) if the target is found.
If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

NOTE: You may assume no duplicates in the array. Users are expected to solve this in O(log(N)) time.



Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 106



Input Format

The first argument is an integer array A of size N.
The second argument is an integer B.



Output Format

Return an integer denoting the index of target value.



Example Input

Input 1:

A = [1, 3, 5, 6]
B = 5 
Input 2:

A = [1]
B = 1


Example Output

Output 1:

2 
Output 2:

0


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

The target value is present at index 2. 
Explanation 2:

The target value is present at index 0.
